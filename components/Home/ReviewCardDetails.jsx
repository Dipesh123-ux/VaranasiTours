      feeling: 'They were recommended to me through a mutual photographer friend. I had two days to spend in India on my own, and I needed the assistance of someone who knows what is happening in the city. The photographers and the whole helping team are very polite people who also happen to be accomplished photographers themselves, with a growing number of Instagram followers to that effect. They understand exactly what a photographer needs,are quick to learn what you are in the mood for, and will tailor the day’s schedule accordingly. They are highly communicative and make it their personal goal to make sure you get what you need from the photo walk. During these two days, we wasted no time visiting bustling local markets, Mosques, and walking the busy streets of the city. Definitely, time well spent, highly recommended.',

      feeling: 'I have been on a few tours with Shivam in the last couple of years. Every time I go out shooting in a group with him, I’m struck by a mixture of ...his knowledge, vision and perspective taking photos, personable relaxed friendly nature, and effortless patience towards amateurs like me. Each time I leave challenged by what I’ve learnt and delighted by the culture we and I have the privilege of connecting with through the lens.',
