      feeling: 'Shivam and Shubham are nothing short of brilliant when it came to assisting me around India. He knows the area very well. He had great suggestions on where to go and was able to take me to places that are out of the way and places that you just never thought of for photography. I love the way they communicated with the people and the people whose portraits I wanted to photograph. They are able to build rapport quickly. The best thing is that they are very respectful of the people that I wanted to photograph and make them feel comfortable as locals by communicating the right things. Definitely a recommendation for your go-to person in India for photography tours and projects.',

      feeling: 'Shivam has an amazing knowledge of the cities of India and what a photographer is uniquely looking for. I have worked with him for my Kolkata photo shoots, but I always recommend them to other photographers coming to India as well looking at the potential that he has for across India. They help you get the shot you want, help you navigate the language and culture, and what’s more, they are super enjoyable guys to be around. ',

      feeling: 'They were recommended to me through a mutual photographer friend. I had two days to spend in India on my own, and I needed the assistance of someone who knows what is happening in the city. They understand exactly what a photographer needs, are quick to learn what you are in the mood for, and will tailor the day’s schedule accordingly. They are highly communicative and make it their personal goal to make sure you get what you need from the photo walk. During these two days, we wasted no time visiting bustling local markets, Mosques, and walking the busy streets of the city. Definitely, time well spent, highly recommended.',
