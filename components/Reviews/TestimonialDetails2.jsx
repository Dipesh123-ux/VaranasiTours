      feeling: 'Shivam’s, photography and his team’s assistance allowed me to be transported back to the city of Kolkata through the eyes of the camera lens, to relive the vibrant beauty that makes Kolkata famous, and to witness more of Shivam’s art. I could tell immediately that Shivam has a passion for photography and the city that he calls home. He is very  knowledgeable, kind, and friendly to everyone that he meets. I am very grateful for the  few days that I spent with him and the fact that he showed me parts of the city that I’d  never heard/read about before. I’d highly recommend anyone wanting to visit Kolkata to  get in touch with him as I know that you won’t be disappointed.',

      feeling: 'I arranged a customized photography tour with them with the specific goal of capturing some great portraits of the local people in their environment. The team had a can-do  attitude and was professional at all times. It was clear Shivam’s local knowledge of India  was invaluable and would help get me to the places I needed to go without wasting any  time. Hopefully, I will get the opportunity to do another customized photography tour with  Shivam in the future. I would highly recommend him to any photographer wanting to  explore India and go a bit deeper than the usual tourist trail.',

He is also a super nice guy and a fun dude to spend time with! I can only say good  things about him and I’m happy to say we became good friends during my time in Kolkata. Definitely recommend him to everyone looking for a reliable and professional assistant in  India.',

They were very flexible to adjust the tour to my requirements. Since they knew the places very well and  also gave good advice for special activities I wanted to do for my photo shootings. It was a  good decision to hire them, even though I had already another but less experienced guide.  I highly recommend hiring them.',

Not only he is a super talented photographer, but also his team is always on time with a big smile, you can feel his love for his work and  he will do his best to help you at any time.
