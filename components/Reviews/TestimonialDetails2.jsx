Every time I go out shooting in a group with him, I’m struck by a mixture of ...his knowledge, vision, and perspective-taking photos, personable relaxed friendly nature, and effortless patience towards amateurs like me. Each time I leave challenged by what I’ve learned and delighted by the culture, we and I have the privilege of connecting with through the lens.',

      feeling: 'Shivam’s, photography and his team’s assistance allowed me to be transported back to the city of Kolkata through the eyes of the camera lens, to relive the vibrant beauty that makes Kolkata famous, and to witness more of Shivam’s art. I could tell immediately that Shivam has a passion for photography and the city that he calls home. He is very  knowledgeable, kind, and friendly to everyone that he meets. I am very grateful for the  few days that I spent with him and the fact that he showed me parts of the city that I’d  never heard/read about before. I’d highly recommend anyone wanting to visit Kolkata to  get in touch with him as I know that you won’t be disappointed.',

He is also a super nice guy and a fun dude to spend time with! I can only say good things about him and I’m happy to say we became good friends during my time in India. Definitely recommend him to everyone looking for a reliable and professional assistant in India.',

      feeling: 'I arranged a customized photography tour with them with the specific goal of capturing some great portraits of the local people in their environment. The team had a can-do  attitude and was professional at all times. It was clear Shivam’s local knowledge of India  was invaluable and would help get me to the places I needed to go without wasting any  time. Hopefully, I will get the opportunity to do another customized photography tour with  Shivam in the future. I would highly recommend him to any photographer wanting to  explore India and go a bit deeper than the usual tourist trail.',
