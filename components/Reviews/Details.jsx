    feeling: 'They were recommended to me through a mutual photographer friend. I had two days to spend in India on my own, and I needed the assistance of someone who knows what is happening in the city. The photographers and the whole helping team are very polite people who also happen to be accomplished photographers themselves, with a growing number of Instagram followers to that effect. They understand exactly what a photographer needs,are quick to learn what you are in the mood for, and will tailor the day’s schedule accordingly. They are highly communicative and make it their personal goal to make sure you get what you need from the photo walk. During these two days, we wasted no time visiting bustling local markets, Mosques, and walking the busy streets of the city. Definitely, time well spent, highly recommended.',

    feeling: 'I have been on a few tours with Shivam in the last couple of years. Every time I go out shooting in a group with him, I’m struck by a mixture of ...his knowledge, vision and perspective taking photos, personable relaxed friendly nature, and effortless patience towards amateurs like me. Each time I leave challenged by what I’ve learnt and delighted by the culture we and I have the privilege of connecting with through the lens.',

    feeling: 'Shivam’s, photography and his team’s assistance allowed me to be transported back to the city of Kolkata through the eyes of the camera lens, to relive the vibrant beauty that makes Kolkata famous, and to witness more of Shivam’s art. I could tell immediately that Shivam has a passion for photography and the city that he calls home. He is very  knowledgeable, kind, and friendly to everyone that he meets. I am very grateful for the  few days that I spent with him and the fact that he showed me parts of the city that I’d  never heard/read about before. I’d highly recommend anyone wanting to visit Kolkata to  get in touch with him as I know that you won’t be disappointed.',

    feeling: 'I arranged a customized photography tour with them with the specific goal of capturing some great portraits of the local people in their environment. The team had a can-do  attitude and was professional at all times. It was clear Shivam’s local knowledge of India  was invaluable and would help get me to the places I needed to go without wasting any  time. Hopefully, I will get the opportunity to do another customized photography tour with  Shivam in the future. I would highly recommend him to any photographer wanting to  explore India and go a bit deeper than the usual tourist trail.',

He is also a super nice guy and a fun dude to spend time with! I can only say good  things about him and I’m happy to say we became good friends during my time in Kolkata. Definitely recommend him to everyone looking for a reliable and professional assistant in  India.',

    feeling: 'I have booked a half-day photo tour with them, to explore one of the market areas of the  city of joy. I liked the little streets we took and the places he showed us. They were very flexible to adjust the tour to my requirements. Since they knew the places very well and  also gave good advice for special activities I wanted to do for my photo shootings. It was a  good decision to hire them, even though I had already another but less experienced guide.  I highly recommend hiring them.',
